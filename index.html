<paper-card heading="In Memory of Jan Weimer">
  <div class="card-content">
<p>On Friday, April 13, 2007 , we lost one of the nationâ€™s most notable and talented food minds. Jan Weimer was an encyclopedic master of all aspects of food: its preparation, sourcing, marketing language and equipment. Widely traveled, she was the free lance author of hundreds of articles, in dozens of publications, some introducing groundbreaking innovations in American Cuisine. Her book on kitchen design is the most comprehensive guide on design principles, sourcing and legal aspects on the shelf. Jan was an Einstein of recipe development. As a genius does, she cooked in her head and could read a recipe like a conductor sight reads sheet music. She won numerous awards for her intellectual achievement, including best paper at the 1999 Appliance Manufacturer Conference and Expo, a rare achievement for a woman and non-engineer. Her career spanned a comprehensive tour of the food world as Executive Food Editor of Bon Appetit Magazine, Assistant Food editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, Chief Culinary Officer of Chefstore.com and consultant to Princess Cruises, Covent Garden Soup Company, Trefethen Winery, numerous restaurants, and many happy home chefs in their new kitchens.</p>
<p>Jan was a graduate of the Paris Cordon Bleu and had, as well, a masters degree from Stanford University in Speech and Audiology. She was a powerful influence on many in the food world and in her chosen avocation, serving selflessly as arts volunteer supporting LACMA. With an unmatchable work ethic and incomparable humility, she served as a role model for many women professionals in diverse fields.</p>
<p>She will be sorely missed by her family and friends. Jan leaves, Sandy, her husband and soulmate of 42 years, her mother, Cyrille, and her brother Sam.</p>

<paper-card heading="About">
<div class="card-content">
  <p>Jan Weimer died on April 13, 2007 after a mostly confidential fifteen year
    battle with breast cancer. She left behind a legacy of creativity, devotion
    and selfless friendship. She mentored many women in their careers and supported
    many causes. As she saw her own end coming, she had a vision to help women
    who are suffering from cancer as she did. We had many conversations about
    our shared estate and vision. Jan wanted to &ldquo;beat the littlef---ers&rdquo; that
    were invading her body. She felt blessed that she could continue her career
    despite side effects of chemotherapy and afford a natural hair wig that kept
    her secret almost to the end.</p>
  <p>To keep faith with her vision, I have led a group of her friends in organizing
    a fund raising effort to endow a chair in breast oncology at Stanford Medical
    School, where we both graduated. Our friend and my medical school classmate,
    Ron Levy, a major researcher in the field of cancer biology and head of Stanford
    Oncology, is the perfect steward for the funds raised. Stanford has committed
    to honor Jan&rsquo;s wishes and fulfill her vision and I have committed our
    estate to the project.</p>
